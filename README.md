# Ch 1

Category

* objects
* morphism
* compose: if A is connected to B and B to C, there must be a morphism from A to C such that
    * associativity: (f . g) . h === f . (g . h)
    * for every object A, there is a morphism id (idA) such that
        * id . f === f and f . id === f

## 1, 2, 3

See class `Composition`.

WWW

* objects: URIs
* morphisms: links
* id: link to self?

NOT a category, it does not compose: if A is linked with B and B to C, A is not necessarily linked to C.
    
### 5

Facebook

* objects: People
* morphisms: Friendships
* id?

NOT a category, it does not compose: if A is friend with B and B with C, it doesn't mean A is friend with C.

### 6

A directed graph is a category IFF each node has an self-arrow and for every arrow A->B and B->C, A->C exists.
