Monoid

u: m x m -> m
n: m

In sets

u: m x m -> m
n: () -> m

  n: picks an element in m
  () is the unit element for product

Monad

Join: T(T a) -> T a
Return: a -> T a == Id a -> T a

The component of the second natural transformation, return, goes from a to T a; in general, a component goes from F a to G a, but if F is Id, then F a = a, so we get a -> G a, and in our case, a -> T a

Categorical monoid

u: T . T -> T
n: I -> M

  I is the unit element for functor composition

A monad is a monoid in the category of end functors
where morphisms are natural transformations
